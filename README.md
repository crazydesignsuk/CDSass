CDSass
=============

CDSass is a collection of default styles to be used with my own web projects to reduce the need of writing similar code at the start of each site. **this is not designed to be a bootstrap replacement!**

It contains default stylings for typography, buttons, tables, and a basic grid. Things can be changed in the main <code>CDSass.scss</code> file.
